## 1. Motivation

A lack of a lightweight, LLM-powered CLI exists in the current ecosystem. Existing solutions like Codex CLI and AIChat are often too heavy or tied to other ecosystems, leaving a gap for a simple alternative. This gap matters because many developers who choose Rust do so for its speed, safety, and efficiency in building small, reliable tools. When they want to experiment with AI-driven workflows, they often have no choice but to rely on bulky tools.

This project addresses that gap while remaining enjoyable to build. It brings together three areas we want to practice deeply: systems programming in Rust, text-based user interface design, and integration of large language models into developer tools. The project is both rewarding to implement and relevant to ongoing conversations about how developers can interact with AI in their day-to-day work.

By setting a realistic scope, we created a polished prototype that demonstrates novelty without being overwhelming. The novelty lies in its Rust-first design, its ability to demonstrate agentic workflows in a lightweight way, and its practical integration into terminal-based development workflows.

---

## 2. Objectives

Build a lightweight, Rust-native terminal assistant that improves day-to-day developer workflows while staying **local**, **fast**, and **safe**.

**Outcome-focused objectives:** 

1. **Keep inference local and private**: Provide a usable LLM experience without relying on hosted APIs, so code and prompts stay on the user’s machine.

2. **Feel native in the terminal**: Deliver a responsive, full-screen TUI experience that supports real iterative work (quick follow-ups, scrollback, and history), not a one-off chatbot demo.

3. **Reduce friction for common repo tasks**: Help users move from “what changed?” to “ready to save/share work” with fewer manual steps and clearer, more structured workflows.

4. **Handle natural language reliably**: Translate a range of everyday phrasing into the right action, while still providing a graceful fallback to normal chat when intent is unclear.

5. **Make automation trustworthy**: Ensure potentially destructive actions are transparent and user-controlled via previews and explicit confirmations.

## 3. Features

### Terminal UI and Conversation Layout

Built with Ratatui, the full-screen interface displays messages labeled as System, User, or Assistant. Long lines wrap properly. The input area stays fixed at the bottom, and a status bar shows the active model, working directory, and runtime state. Users can scroll with PgUp/PgDn and navigate input history with Up/Down arrows.

### Chat Model and Streaming Output

Uses Ollama for local inference with streaming output—text appears progressively rather than all at once. Default model is `llama3`, configurable via environment variable or config file. Startup health checks verify Ollama connectivity and model availability.

### Session Context and Semantic References

Tracks working directory, repository root, and project type. Maintains input history and a window of recent outputs (last 5, max 2000 chars each). When reference words like "it", "that", or "the diff" are detected, relevant context is injected into the LLM prompt. This enables natural follow-up: "show status" followed by "commit it" works as expected.

### Intent Routing, Workflows, and Command Learning

In this project, a **workflow** means a user-facing action that expands into a **series of individual commands** (e.g., multiple `git` steps) with **previews + explicit confirmation** before execution. We use this term throughout the CLI because many “smart” behaviors (git automation, running commands suggested by the LLM, and saving custom commands) share the same plan/confirm/execute pattern.

#### Tiered Intent Resolution (how text becomes an action)

**Tier 1 (< 1ms)**: Fuzzy matching against learned aliases, exact tool names, and examples. Resolves 90% of common commands instantly.

**Tier 2 (~50ms)**: Hybrid scoring combining keyword matching (60% weight) and semantic embeddings (40% weight). Requires `nomic-embed-text` model. Handles paraphrasing and synonyms.

**Tier 3 (~500ms)**: Small LLM classifier (default: `qwen2:1.5b`) handles novel phrasing. Falls back to chat when uncertain.

This tiered routing is what decides whether your input should start a **workflow** (e.g., a git workflow), run a single tool action, run a shell command, or fall back to chat.

### Command Routing and Safety

Supports two modes toggled with Ctrl+S:
- **Chat Mode**: Natural language processed through intent system or sent to LLM
- **Shell Mode**: Direct shell command execution

In Chat mode, prefix commands with `$` or `!` for shell execution. Bang shortcuts (`!!` for last command, `!prefix` for last command starting with prefix) provide bash-style convenience. When the LLM suggests shell commands, users must confirm before execution.

#### Git Workflows (multi-step)

**Save work**: Shows plan with status preview, asks confirmation, stages changes, generates commit message based on staged diff, lets user accept/override message, commits, and pushes. Execution report shows results.

**Status**: Shows `git status --short` and `diff --stat` summary. User can type a file path to view that file's diff.

**Commit**: Commits without push, with LLM-generated message suggestion.

**Stage**: Stages changes with confirmation.

**Draft commit message**: Generates commit message from staged changes.

### File Operations and Code Search

**Show file**: Displays file contents in conversation (e.g., "show src/main.rs")

**List files**: Lists directory contents (e.g., "list files in src")

**Write file**: Creates/overwrites files with confirmation (e.g., "write to notes.txt with content: ...")

**Find TODOs**: Ripgrep-based search for TODO/FIXME comments (requires `rg` on PATH)

#### Custom Command Learning (workflow special case)

When the LLM generates shell commands, users can execute them (`y`), save them as learned commands (`s`), or skip (`n`). Learned commands are matched instantly (< 1ms) in Tier 1 on subsequent uses, enabling personalized workflows.

### Ghost Text Completion

As users type, ghost text suggestions appear and can be accepted with Tab. Completions are mode-aware (Chat vs Shell) and come from three sources: tool examples, recent history, and learned phrases.

**How the suggestion is chosen (high-level algorithm):**
- **Path completion first**: If the last token looks like a path, the CLI suggests filesystem completions from the current directory, prioritizing candidates by a **file frecency score** (recent/frequent file paths), and appending `/` for directories.
- **Otherwise, command completion**:
  - **Candidate pool**: tool examples + the most recent history entries + learned phrases.
  - **Scoring**: each candidate gets a **fuzzy-match score** against your current input, then receives a **frecency boost** so frequently/recently used items are preferred.
  - **Display rule**: ghost text only appears when the chosen candidate **starts with your current input**, and the UI shows only the **remaining suffix** (so Tab completes what you’ve already typed).

### Embedding Cache

Pre-computed embeddings for tool examples are cached in `.llm-cli/embeddings.toml`, providing 10-20x startup speedup (from ~1-2s to ~0.1s). Cache invalidates automatically if the embedding model changes.

### Help / Manual

Typing `help` (or `?`) shows an in-app manual with modes, key bindings, and common commands. The CLI also supports standard Clap help output via `--help`.

## 4. User Guide

### Getting Started (Setup + Run)

This section is a “from zero to running” setup. For OS-specific install details (macOS vs Ubuntu), see **Reproducibility Guide**; the steps below describe the required components and the exact commands you’ll run once they’re installed.

#### 1) Install prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain**: `rustc` + `cargo` (via `rustup`)
- **Ollama**: installed and running locally
- **Git**: recommended (required for git-related workflows)
- **ripgrep (`rg`)**: optional (required only for `find todos`)

### Using the CLI (after it launches)

After starting, the full-screen interface opens with a conversation panel at top and an input area at bottom.

A `help` page is available inside the app with 'help' or '?' in `Chat` mode, showing all available commands and key bindings.

**Essential keyboard shortcuts:**
- Type naturally and press Enter to chat
- Up/Down: Navigate input history
- Ctrl+S: Toggle between Chat and Shell modes
- Tab: Accept ghost text completion
- PgUp/PgDn: Scroll conversation
- Esc/q/Ctrl+C: Quit

**Git workflows:**
Pre-configured git workflows are available when running inside a git repository.

```
status                    # Show git status and diffstat
save work                 # Stage, commit with generated message, and push
commit                    # Commit without push
stage all                 # Stage all changes
draft commit message      # Generate commit message from staged changes
```

If you forget commands or key bindings at any time, type `help` (or `?`) inside the app.

**File operations:**
```
show src/main.rs         # Display file contents
list files in src        # List directory
write to notes.txt with content: ...  # Create/overwrite file
```

**Code search:**
```
find todos               # Search TODO/FIXME (requires ripgrep)
```

**Shell mode:**
- Toggle with Ctrl+S to run shell commands directly
- Built-in: `cd <path>`, `pwd`

**Bang shortcuts in Chat mode:**
```
$ ls -la                 # Execute shell command
! pwd                    # Execute shell command (alternative)
!!                       # Repeat last shell command
!cargo                   # Run last command starting with "cargo"
```

**Custom commands:**

When the LLM suggests shell commands, type:
- `y` or `yes`: Execute
- `s` or `save`: Save as learned command
- `n` or `no`: Skip

**Configuration (`.llm-cli/config.toml`):**

- Copy `config.example.toml` to `.llm-cli/config.toml` to configure models, prompts, timeouts, and storage paths. Pass an explicit file via `cargo run -- --config /path/to/config.toml` if needed.
- When the file is missing, the CLI falls back to built-in defaults so it still works out of the box. Those defaults are:
  - `model = "llama3"`
  - `system_prompt = "Reply in concise bullets. Use short sentences. Break lines for each bullet. Be direct."`
  - `llm_timeout_secs = 45`
  - `cmd_timeout_secs = 60`
  - `max_context_tokens = 4096`
  - `streaming = true`
  - `request_timeout_secs = 60`
  - `generate_commit_message = true`
  - `history_path = ".llm-cli/history.jsonl"`
  - `embedding_cache_path = ".llm-cli/embeddings.toml"`
  - `embedding_model = "nomic-embed-text"`
  - `classifier_model = "qwen2:1.5b"`
  - `learned_path = ".llm-cli/learned.toml"`

You can also override any field temporarily with environment variables:
```bash
export LLM_CLI_MODEL="llama3:8b"
export LLM_CLI_STREAMING="true"
```

All project-specific files are stored in `.llm-cli/` directory (history, learned commands, embeddings, frecency data).

An example config file with comments is provided as `config.example.toml`. Feel free to copy it to `.llm-cli/config.toml` and modify as needed.

ollama pull llama3.2:3b
cargo run
```

**Custom config:**

Create `.llm-cli/config.toml` in your project directory (see User Guide for format).

### Quick Sanity Checks

After the UI opens:

1. **Test chat**: Type "describe this repo" and confirm streaming response appears
2. **Test history**: Press Up to recall last prompt, edit, and resend
3. **Test git workflow** (if in repo): Type `save work` to show git status and diffstat
4. **Test file operations**: Type `show Cargo.toml` or `list files in src`
5. **Test TODO search** (if ripgrep installed): Type `find todos`

## 7. Lessons Learned and Concluding Remarks

**Streaming output matters for perceived performance.** Even when a model takes the same time to finish, showing text as it arrives makes the tool feel faster and more responsive. Implementing streaming pushed us to design clearer separation between rendering, state, and background work.

**Agentic behavior must be trustworthy.** Developers are comfortable with automation when they can predict outcomes and execution is intentional. Our plan-and-execute approach with confirmations demonstrates that multi-step workflows can be powerful while keeping users in control.

**Repository awareness doesn't need complexity.** Simply detecting the repo root, exposing status/diff previews, and generating commit messages from staged diffs already supports common tasks effectively. This incremental approach delivers value early and provides a clear path for future enhancements.

**Tiered intent resolution balances speed and flexibility.** By combining fuzzy matching (< 1ms), semantic embeddings (~50ms), and LLM classification (~500ms) with natural fallback to chat, we created a system that feels fast for common commands while gracefully handling novel phrasing. Most users develop habits, so optimizing for the common case while providing flexibility for exploration creates a system that adapts to user behavior over time.

**Terminal UI stability requires attention to detail.** Handling raw mode correctly, keeping layout consistent, wrapping text, truncating large outputs, and showing clear error messages all matter for reliability. These details became especially important because the tool must remain readable while actively streaming output.

**Startup performance has outsized impact.** The embedding cache system's 10-20x speedup transformed the tool from "slow to start" to "instant," fundamentally changing how willing we were to restart it frequently. Performance optimizations that improve iteration speed matter significantly for developer tools.

**Simple heuristics can enable natural interaction.** Semantic context resolution via reference detection doesn't require sophisticated NLP. Simple string matching for pronouns and explicit references combined with a small queue of recent outputs created a surprisingly effective system for follow-up interactions.

**Clear boundaries between LLM and deterministic code matter.** The model is strongest at explanation and summarization, while deterministic commands are best for actions like reading files, searching code, and running git operations. Keeping those roles separate made the tool easier to reason about and safer to use.

**Future directions** include deeper repository analysis (AST parsing, symbol indexing), multi-file editing with diff previews, integration with external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol), collaborative features (sharing learned commands), and performance optimization for large repositories.

The project achieved its goal of creating a lightweight, Rust-native LLM-powered CLI that feels natural in developer workflows. More importantly, it demonstrated that local inference, semantic intent matching, and careful UX design can combine to create tools that augment rather than replace human decision-making.
